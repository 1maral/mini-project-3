**Notes for the reader**

This project enables users to construct ASCII text blocks, align them, and combine them in many ways. It includes features for horizontal and vertical composition, flipping blocks both horizontally and vertically, and surrounding blocks with borders. By providing a range of block types (like lines, boxes, and grids) and alignment options (CENTER, TOP, BOTTOM), mp-blocks-maven offers many ways to create ASCII arts using our classes.
